# Utopia
Utopia - a shitty gaming console for Arduino Uno

uses a joystick, a passive buzzer, and a 128x64px display

see hardware.jpg for cable connections etc.

see utopia.ino file for necessary libraries

Please note that this is a not-too-serious weekend project, therefore the code is rather messy.
